## UPDATEs in recent commit:
- Adding feature for moving to previous line and next line using `h` and `l` respectively.

## USAGE:
- overriding standard behaviour for copy pasting in vim: `set clipboard=unnamed`
- save file: `CTRL+z`
- quit file: `,+e` (here `,` is leaderkey)
- switching between tabs:
	- `,+n` for going to left tab
	- `,+m` for going to right tab
- switching between splits(horizontal split):
	- `CTRL+j` for going up
	- `CTRL+k` for going down
- swithcing between vertical splits:
	- `CTRL+l` for right
	- `CTRL+h` for left
